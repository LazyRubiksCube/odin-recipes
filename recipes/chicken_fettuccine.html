<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat large skillet on medium high heat with oil</li>
    <li>In a small bowl combine 1 and 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, and 1/4 tsp. smoked parika. Sprinkle mixture onto all sides of chicken and rub in</li>
    <li>Lay chicken into pan. Do not move, so arrange accordingly. Do not crowd the chicken. This will allow a nice sear.</li>
    <li>Lower heat to medium once all chicken is in and cook for 4 minutes.</li>
    <li>Use tongs to flip each piece, swirl the pan as necessary to coat with oil. Immediately add 1 tbsp. butter to the pan and swirl as it melts. Cook the chicken on 2nd side for ~2 minutes or registers 160 degrees F. Remove and plate chicken, cover to keep warm.</li>
    <li>Fill 3 quarts of water to a pot. Add 1 tbsp, .salt and bring to a boil over high heat. When water is rolling add fettuccine. Stir occasionally so noodles don't stick. Cook for about 10 minujtes or until noodles are al dente. Drain, but be sure to save about a cup of the pasta water. Set aside in small bowl and drizzle olive oil, and stir.</li>
    <li>Back to chicken pan, add 3/4 c. of butter over medium heat. Allow to melt and bubble a bit, (DO NOT BROWN) then add 5 cloves of smashed and minced garlic. Saute for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Slowly add 2 c. of cream while stirring. Begin to add 1 1/4 tsp kosher salt, 1/2 tsp. black pepper, 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper, and 1/8 tsp. nutmeg.</li>
    <li>Let the cream mixture cook over medium heat for about 3 minutes until you see gentle bubbles on the side of the pan. Lower heat to medium low.</li>
    <li>Finely shred 1 and 1/2 c. parmesan cheese using grater.</li>
    <li>Slowly add cheese to the sauce stirring between each, this will help cheese melt more thoroughly and allow for a smooth sauce.</li>
    <li>Taste to test and add additional seasoning to liking.</li>
    <li>Add noodles in batches so that they coat well.</li>
    <li>With a sharp, serrated knife slice chicken into serving strips. Plate pasta and arrange chicken atop or add the chicken to the pasta in the pan.</li>
    <li>Top each serving with extra parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of parley.</li>
